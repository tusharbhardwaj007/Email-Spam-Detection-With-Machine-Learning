# Email-Spam-Detection-With-Machine-Learning
Email spam detection with machine learning is the process of using algorithms to identify and filter out unwanted or malicious emails (spam) from legitimate ones (ham). 
It involves training a model on labeled email data, where the emails are categorized as either spam or ham. 
The model learns patterns in the text, such as specific words, phrases, or frequencies, that are commonly found in spam emails.
Steps in the process include:
Data Collection: Gathering a dataset of labeled emails (spam and ham).
Preprocessing: Converting text data into a numerical format that the machine learning model can interpret, often using techniques like TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).
Model Training: Using algorithms like Naive Bayes, which is effective for text classification, to learn from the training data.
Prediction and Evaluation: Applying the trained model to new emails to predict whether they are spam or ham, and evaluating its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.
Deployment: Integrating the model into email systems to automatically filter out spam emails.
